# 📂 NLP Pipelines

This folder contains **9 essential NLP preprocessing pipelines**, each implemented as a simple and practical Jupyter Notebook.

Every notebook includes:
- A short Markdown overview  
- One or two example code blocks  
- A minimal demonstration of the concept  

These notebooks help beginners understand the core steps of Natural Language Processing (NLP).
