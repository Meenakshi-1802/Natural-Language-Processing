# 🧠 Natural Language Processing (NLP)

## *Welcome to my Natural Language Processing (NLP) repository!*
This repo contains my complete hands-on journey through essential NLP concepts — from basic text preprocessing to advanced techniques like word embeddings and sense disambiguation.

It also includes practice exercises and real mini-projects to strengthen foundational skills required for Data Analyst, ML Engineer, and NLP beginner roles.

# 🚀 What’s Included in This Repository?
